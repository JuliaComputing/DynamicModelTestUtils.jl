# DynamicModelTestUtils
DynamicModelTestUtils is a simple package that wraps SymbolicIndexingInterface to provide straightforward model regression analysis & comparision functionality. 

It can export model result data using `discretize_solution` into a DataFrame and can compare against those DataFrames using `compare`. It's intended for use in CI pipelines.
