# ModelTesting

Documentation for [ModelTesting](https://github.com/BenChung/ModelTesting.jl).

ModelTesting is intended to facilitate the easy testing and post-facto analysis of ModelingToolkit models. It currently provides two key bits of functionality:

* Serialization of MTK solutions into a common format through `discretize_solution`.
* Comparison of solutions to each other and to previously-saved data through `compare`.
